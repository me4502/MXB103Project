# MXB103Project

This project is a MATLAB report made for MXB103, a mathematics unit at QUT.

To recreate the report, clone the repo and use the resulting directory as the
MATLAB working directory. From this point, you can then use the `Publish` 
features of MATLAB to publish the report as a HTML document.

The report is a hypothetical situation where a bungee jumping platform was to 
be built off a bridge. The report goes over a few different feasibility 
questions to ensure maximal safety and 'thrill factor'.
